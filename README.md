## Available Resources

### Local Resources
- **Laptops**
  - 4090 Ti Laptop (64GB RAM): For tracking and in-lab use only (Do not remove from lab)
  - 4080 Ti Laptop: Available for demos (Can be taken out of lab)

- **Workstations**
  - Workstation 1: 2 × 4090 Ti (64GB RAM)
  - Workstation 2: 1 × 3090 Ti, 1 x 1080 Ti (32GB RAM)

Note: Workstations are primarily for PhD students. If you need access to local workstations, please discuss with the professor first.
