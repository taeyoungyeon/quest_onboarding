## Overview

The lab provides local workstation resources for research purposes. Access is carefully managed to ensure fair distribution of resources, especially during conference paper deadlines.

## Available Storage

- **Local Workstations**: 4TB space (for small datasets and configuration tests only)
- **NAS Server**: 20TB total storage (for large datasets)
